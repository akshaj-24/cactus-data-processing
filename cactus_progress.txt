I do not currently have friends. I believe that without friends, my life will be meaningless. I am convinced that my situation is worse than it actually is and that I am unable to make any positive changes. I focus only on the negative aspects of my life and assume that this pattern will continue indefinitely. I believe that my lack of friends is solely my fault and that I am completely incapable of forming meaningful relationships.
