Animals will reject me if they realize I don't remember them, so I must avoid the shelter to prevent their hatred and my guilt.

I have an interest in crystals that has been a significant part of my daily routine for several years. I began collecting and using crystals for meditation and decoration. I received some negative comments from acquaintances about my interest, which led to more negative remarks over time. These comments have caused me to feel isolated and have strained my relationships with acquaintances and friends. I have tried to focus on my passion for crystals despite the negative remarks, but they still affect me. My job performance as a seamstress has remained satisfactory. I have a few friends I can talk to about general topics but do not feel comfortable discussing my feelings of isolation and judgment with them. I have not experienced similar problems or received treatment for psychological issues in the past. I have sought counseling to address these issues.

I have 8 brothers and we are close, but we don't live near each other. During the pandemic, travel restrictions limited our ability to see each other. Since then, I have experienced persistent worries about losing touch with my brothers and never being able to reunite. These thoughts occur almost daily, especially when I see news about the pandemic or travel restrictions. I have tried to distract myself with hobbies and activities, but the worries return. The anxiety has impacted my daily life and relationships. I have not discussed my fears directly with my brothers. I have not had previous psychological issues or treatment. I am currently seeking counseling for support.
